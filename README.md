# Stimuli for fast mapping of visual response properties 

This repository describes two visual stimuli used in functional descriptions of cortical circuits: Monet and Trippy.  
Both stimuli were designed to simultaneously measure linear receptive fields and motion tuning of visually responsive neurons.

## SfN 2018 Poster
Some of the results from using these stimuli were included in our SfN 2018 poster:
