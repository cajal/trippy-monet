# Stimuli for fast mapping of visual response properties 

This repository describes two visual stimuli used in functional descriptions of cortical circuits: Monet and Trippy.  
Both stimuli were designed to simultaneously measure linear receptive fields and motion tuning of visually responsive neurons.

## SfN 2018 Poster
Some of the results from using these stimuli were included in our SfN 2018 poster:

## The Monet Stimulus
The Monet stimulus comprises smoothened Gaussian noise with coherent orientation and motion in various directions. 
A sample of the stimulus can be found here: https://vimeo.com/249686342



## The Trippy stimulus
The Trippy stimulus comprises irregular fluid ripples wriggling randomly across the visual field; they are synthesized as the cosine of a smooth Guassian noise movie.
